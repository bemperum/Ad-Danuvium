Introduction and a hint
Ad Danuvium is a fantasy setting which takes its ideas from the Roman Empire in the 2nd Century. It is explicitely not historically correct. However existing locations and events are used as a decoration.

Setting
Ad Danuvium is a mixture of historical setting and fantasy. The fantasy elements are taken from the myths of ancient times. The timeframe may be a cold winter in 179/180 A.D.

"We are in Carnuntum. It's the biggest city on the Roman Empire's part of the legendary amber road. Emperor Marcus Aurelius resides here directly at the Limes Pannonicus to lead the war against the approaching barbarian clans from the north. The roman soldiers at the confluence of the March and Danube river are sent into the wildlands for expeditions and patrolling. The water meadows are grim and foggy. The empire also has forts located on the outskirts next to the enemies. Transportation is done by feet or oxcarts, raft or galley. But it's difficult, as the winter is cold and relentless.

Carnuntum is a melting pot for cultures and an important trade center. Amber is brought by brave merchants from the baltic sea all the way trough the wild lands into the empire behind the Limes. From there it is on it's via Scarabantia to the south. It passes Julia Emona and finally reaches Aquileia on the adriatic coast. Aquileia normally is the emperor's sommer location. 

Even though Rome tries to make it's citizens belive that empire is stable and and secure, life is dangerous! The barbarian clans from the north attack roman citizens whenever the get a chance to and sacrifice their lifes to their heathen gods. Highwaymen take the merchants' goods and gold. When get caught, you may end up a slave. 
Wolves and bears are hungry and roam for food and get quite close to human settlements. The antonin pestilence has alread taken one third of people. And if that wasn't enough, rumors have it that dark creatures, monsters and ghosts are waiting at the woods, shrines and hot springs.
